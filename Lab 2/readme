📉 Lab 2: Deflating History with FRED
The Illusion of Growth & The Composition Effect

Analyzing 50 years of wage stagnation and exposing the statistical mirage of the 2020 "wage boom."

<br>
🎯 Objective
Build an automated Python pipeline to ingest live economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API in order to:

Calculate inflation-adjusted ("real") wages and visualize long-term stagnation
Identify and correct for the Composition Effect—a statistical bias that distorted wage data during the COVID-19 pandemic

📊 Methodology
1. Data Ingestion
Series IDDescriptionAHETPIAverage Hourly Earnings of All Employees (Total Private)CPIAUCSLConsumer Price Index for All Urban ConsumersECIWAGEmployment Cost Index (Wages & Salaries)
2. Inflation Adjustment
Deflated nominal wages (AHETPI) against CPI to compute Real Wages, revealing true purchasing power over time.
3. Anomaly Detection
Identified a sharp upward spike in Q2 2020—average wages surged during an economic contraction. This counterintuitive result triggered further investigation.
4. Composition Effect Correction
Introduced the Employment Cost Index (ECI) as a control. Unlike raw averages, the ECI tracks wage changes for a fixed basket of occupations, neutralizing shifts in workforce composition.

🔍 Key Findings
The Money Illusion
Show Image
Real wages have remained effectively flat for over 50 years. Despite nominal earnings appearing to grow, workers' purchasing power has stagnated—a classic demonstration of the "Money Illusion."

The Pandemic Paradox
Show Image
The 2020 "wage boom" was not a sign of increased labor demand.
What happened:

Pandemic layoffs disproportionately hit low-wage sectors (hospitality, retail, services)
The remaining workforce skewed toward higher earners
The average rose because lower earners exited the sample—not because anyone received a raise

The proof:
The ECI, which holds occupation mix constant, shows no corresponding spike. The apparent wage surge occurred precisely when workers had the least leverage.

💡 Conclusion
Headline economic statistics can mislead without proper context. By leveraging the FRED API and applying compositional controls, this project distinguishes genuine economic phenomena from artifacts of measurement.
