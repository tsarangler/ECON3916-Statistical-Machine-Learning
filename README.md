**ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**  
*Bridging Traditional Economic Theory with Modern Machine Learning*

---

## 👋 About Me

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about leveraging data science to solve real-world economic problems. I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Economic Consulting** and **Finance**, where I can apply both rigorous economic thinking and cutting-edge analytical techniques.

My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional economic theory and modern data science—combining the **why** of causal inference with the **what** of predictive analytics.

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository showcases my coursework and lab projects from **ECON 3916**, where I'm learning to scale foundational statistical concepts into powerful machine learning applications.

**Course Philosophy:**  
We use a **"Concept Extension"** approach—starting with core statistical methods (like OLS regression) and extending them through advanced ML algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and Random Forests). This framework allows me to:

- Apply **causal inference** techniques to understand economic relationships
- Build **predictive models** that scale to high-dimensional data
- Translate economic questions into data-driven solutions

Each project demonstrates my ability to work with real economic datasets, interpret results through an economic lens, and communicate findings clearly.
